# JWT authentication example in Deno REST API

### It uses [oak framework](https://deno.land/x/oak) and [djwt](https://deno.land/x/djwt) package.
The code is an example which shows how you can use JWT authentication when building REST API-s using oak framework.

>The project was created along with Youtube Video ["JWT Authentication in Deno REST API"](https://youtu.be/2Skms0gkUXk). I appreaciate if you like the video and share it.
